# React Tunes

I ❤️ React and I ❤️ music!

So I decided to experiment with React components and the Web Audio API to finally come up with this.

The basic concept is that each declared component is rendered given a start time offset for the Audio to kick in. Each offset is calculated based on the position of the component in the element tree.

I gave a [talk at Xebicon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=587URAa3Imw) last year about this.

Feel free to fork / create issues or why not create a pull request ? :)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
